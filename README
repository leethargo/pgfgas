PGF Gas - Using TikZ circuits to draw gas networks.
===================================================

(c) Robert Schwarz, 2011, <schwarz@zib.de>

This package defines four new symbols for common elements in natural
gas networks:

 - Compressors    (cs)
 - Valves         (va)
 - Control valves (cv)
 - Resistors      (re)

See example.tex for an example of the usage.

Requires pgf with circuits library, e.g., version 2.10
